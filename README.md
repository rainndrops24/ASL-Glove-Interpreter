• Collaborated with my partner, Michaela Romero, to develop this glove that would translate hand position into ASL

• Stemming from my partners interest in ASL, we set out to develop a device that would translate ASL.

• We saw this as a potential learning aid for those learning ASL, as well, we also saw this being another way of communication by displaying ASL onto a device.

• Using a glove, arduino microcontroller, and flex sensors, we developed the Glove ASL Interpretor

• After calibration to a user’s hand, the resistance exhibited by the five flex sensors are converted and then translated to ASL through the arduino

• Project was presented in BME 101, and was the highest voted in the class

• Inspired by projects seen on arduino's project hub: https://projecthub.arduino.cc/ayooluwa98/sensor-glove-for-sign-language-translation-c14ae7

• Interpreter developed with C++ on the Arduino IDE

• Supplemental application developed for IOS using Swift in Xcode
