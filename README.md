• Collaborated with my partner, Michaela Romero, to develop a glove that would translate hand position into ASL

• Using a glove, arduino microcontroller, and flex sensors, we developed a Glove ASL Interpretor

• Inspired by projects seen on arduino's project hub: https://projecthub.arduino.cc/ayooluwa98/sensor-glove-for-sign-language-translation-c14ae7

• Interpreter developed with C++ on the Arduino IDE

• Supplemental application developed for IOS using Swift in xCode
